1. Operating Data Logging Section:
Required parameters to log:
a) Pressure readings:
   - Feed pressure (psi)
   - Permeate pressure (psi)
   - Concentrate pressure (psi)
   - Pressure drop per stage
   - Pressure drop per filter cartridge

b) Flow measurements:
   - Feed flow (gpm)
   - Permeate flow (gpm)
   - Concentrate flow (gpm)

c) Water quality:
   - Conductivity (Feed, Permeate, Concentrate)
   - TDS calculations using K-factors:
     * Permeate (0.1-1 mS/m): K = 0.50
     * Permeate (30-80 mS/m): K = 0.55
     * Seawater (4500-6000 mS/m): K = 0.70
     * Concentrate (6500-8500 mS/m): K = 0.75
   - pH values
   - Temperature (°C)

2. Performance Normalization Section:
Implement these specific calculations:

a) Normalized Permeate Flow:
Qs = [(Pf - ΔP/2 - Pp - πfc) / (Pf - ΔP/2 - Pp - πfc)o] × [TCFs/TCFo] × Qo
Where:
- Pf = feed pressure
- ΔP = pressure drop
- Pp = permeate pressure
- πfc = osmotic pressure
- TCF = temperature correction factor
- Q = flow rate
- Subscript s = standard condition
- Subscript o = operating condition

b) Temperature Correction Factor:
For T ≥ 25°C: TCF = EXP[2640 × (1/298 - 1/(273 + T))]
For T ≤ 25°C: TCF = EXP[3020 × (1/298 - 1/(273 + T))]

c) Osmotic Pressure:
For Cfc < 20000 mg/L:
πfc = [Cfc × (T + 320)] / 491000

d) Feed-Concentrate:
Cfc = Cf × [ln(1/(1-Y))/Y]
Where:
- Y = recovery ratio
- Cf = feed TDS

3. User Interface Requirements:
a) Data Entry Form with:
   - Input validation
   - Unit conversions
   - Date/time stamps
   - Save/update functionality

b) Results Display:
   - Normalized performance values
   - Comparison with baseline/start-up data
   - Warning indicators for significant deviations

4. Important Implementation Notes:
- Start-up values should be preserved as reference points
- Include error handling for invalid inputs
- Implement real-time calculations
- Show clear performance trends
- Flag significant deviations from baseline

Please implement proper error handling and validation throughout the application.
